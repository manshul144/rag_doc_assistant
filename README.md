RAG Document Assistant is an AI-powered application that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide accurate, context-aware answers from documents. Instead of relying only on the modelâ€™s memory, it retrieves relevant document chunks and uses them to generate precise responses.
